# todo-list-nancy-demo
Very simple "TODO task management" web application demonstrating some features of NancyFX with web client in knockout.js.

This application contains REST API written with NancyFX that allows to:
- get all notes,
- get note by id,
- add new note,
- update existing note,
- delete note by id.

There is also a web page that consumes mentioned API by issuing AJAX requests using jQuery.
